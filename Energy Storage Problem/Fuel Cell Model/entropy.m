function S = entropy(varargin) % entropy (S) 
% returns both entropy in kJ/kmol, or in rate form kJ/s
% Option 1: provide a vector of temperatures and it returns entropy for all species CH4, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, N2, O2, C, NO, OH, H
% Option 2: provide a vector of temperatures and a cell array of strings for the species of interest
% Option 3: provide a structure where __.T coresponds to temperature, ___.CH4 coresponds to the flow rate of methane ____.H2 to the flow rate of hydrogen...
% Option 3 returns the rate form  (kJ/s)
